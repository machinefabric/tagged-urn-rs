# Regenerate everything this crate takes from the proved model in ../formal:
# the Lean is checked (every proof), the conformance table is written, and
# lungo turns the model's executable surface into src/generated.
#
# Needs elan (the toolchain ../formal/lean-toolchain pins) and cargo-lungo at
# the version Cargo.toml pins for `lungo`. Nothing else in this crate does:
# src/generated is checked in, and a crate compiling this one needs neither.
#
# Run it after changing ../formal, and commit what it writes.
